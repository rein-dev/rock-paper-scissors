# rock-paper-scissors

Project 3

/**************PART1**************/

Writing a rock, paper, scissors game with Javascript. What have I learned:

- Make use of functions
- Used regular expressions to match my outcomes
- Get input from a user with the prompt screen
- Set a delay before starting the game
- Display game info through the console

I will style this game later on.
